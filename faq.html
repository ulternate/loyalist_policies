<h3>What cards can I scan?</h3>
<p>You can scan any loyalty card with any of the following barcode types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>EAN-8 & 13</li>
    <li>UPC A & E</li>
    <li>Code 39 & 128</li>
    <li>QR Codes</li>
</ul>
<p>These barcode types represent the common barcode types used by loyalty cards, if your card won't add please send us a picture of the barcode or tell us the barcode type and try and support it.</p>

<h3>Why would I create multiple wallets? Why not store all my cards in one wallet?</h3>
<p>You can do what ever you wish! There are no restrictions on how many wallets or cards you can add and there never will be.
Some people like to have all their cards in one large wallet, whilst others like to have their cards grouped together
in separate wallets based on card type. Why not let us know what you prefer.</p>

<h3>My card won't scan</h3>
<p>If your card won't scan, ask the salesperson to enter in your barcode number manually, it's listed under your barcode.</p>
<p>Some flatbed Laser scanners used in some stores fail to scan as the laser gets refracted off some screens reflection. Some phone screen types work better with Laser scanners than others.</p>
<p>The good news is that optical scanners work 100% of the time, regardless of screen type. If the salesperson has an optical scanner ask them to scan your phone with it instead.</p>

<h3>Why is my barcode number different from my membership number?</h3>
<p>Some loyalty providers use unique numbers for your membership information which are different from your
    cards barcode number. In these cases the number printed on your card is actually your membership number
    and not the number encoded into the barcode.</p>
<p>The number encoded into the barcode is how the scanner identifies you not your membership number. In these situations you can add a note to your card and
    add your membership number to your notes and view them when you view your card.</p>
<p>We don't know why they don't use the membership number as your barcode number, why not contact them and ask?</p>
