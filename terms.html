<h1><b>Loyalist Terms and Conditions</b></h1></html><br>

<body>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<h4>Effective on September 4th 2014</h4>

<br><h2><b>Terms</b></h2>
<p>By accessing any mobile applications run by <b>Loyalist</b>, you are agreeing to be bound by these
    Terms and Conditions of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible
    for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are
    prohibited from using or accessing this application and services. The materials contained in this
    application are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

<br><h2>Use of Application</h2>
<p>Permission is granted to use the Loyalist mobile application. This is the grant of a license,
    not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p><ul>
    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose,
        or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the
        Loyalist mobile application(s);</li>
    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
    <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials in another application.</li>
    </ul>
<p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be
    terminated by Loyalist at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
    termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether
    in electronic or printed format.</p>

<br><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Loyalist's application(s) are provided "as is". Loyalist makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
    hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties
    or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
    intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Loyalist does not warrant or make any
    representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials
    in its applications(s).</p>

<br><h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>In no event shall Loyalist or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation,
    damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or
    inability to use the materials on Loyalist's application(s), even if Loyalist or a Loyalist
    authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
    Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
    liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. </p>
